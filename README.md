# Cam Profile and Motion Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project involves MATLAB scripts for analyzing the motion of a cam and plotting its profile. The project calculates the displacement of a follower based on different motion conditions such as dwell, ascent, and descent.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- **`Q1.m`**: MATLAB script for cam profile generation and motion analysis using squared displacement motion.
- **`Q2.m`**: MATLAB script for cam profile generation and motion analysis using harmonic motion.

## ðŸ“Š Features
- Computes the lift of a follower based on predefined cam angles.
- Plots **Cam Angle vs. Lift** for visualization.
- Generates **Polar Plots** for cam profile representation.
- Converts polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates for 3D visualization.

## ðŸ”§ Setup and Usage
1. Install MATLAB (if not already installed).  
2. Clone this repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tina748/cam-profile.git
   cd cam-profile
